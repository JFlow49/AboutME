# About Me

Hello,

I am currently an undergraduate student at Texas Tech University studying Management Information Systems (MIS) and working towards obtaining a minor in mathematics. 

I originally started out majoring in Electrical Engineering but decided that I was more interested in the software side of things opposed to hardware. Therefore, I decided to change my major to Management Information Systems where I can use my quantitative and logical skills  in addition to my interpersonal skills. A degree in Management Information Systems prepares me to use technical skills along side management skills to solve problems in the business environment.

My interests include software development, database management, hardware design, and network security. In my free time, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies, playing and watching sports, boating, fishing, programming, and playing video games.

If you would like to know anymore about me, you can contact me at Jordan.Flowers@ttu.edu

Thanks,
  Jordan Flowers
